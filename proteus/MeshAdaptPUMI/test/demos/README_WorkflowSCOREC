The SCOREC libraries and tools require different inputs than base proteus build. 
Specifically, the SCOREC libraries require SCOREC meshes and models. 
Moreover, any parallel implementation would require splitting the mesh prior to initiating proteus.
The following document aims to detail the various workflows to achieve a working simulation with SCOREC tools.
SCOREC meshes have a .smb filetype and SCOREC models have a .dmg filetype.
The conversion utilities listed come from SCOREC/core (open-source) or SCOREC/core-sim (with Simmetrix functionalities).

//*******//
GMSH
//*******//

1. Given the .geo files, make a corresponding GMSH mesh as usual: 
   gmsh name.geo -v 10 -3 
2. Convert the GMSH msh into a SCOREC mesh: 
   from_gmsh <input.null> <input.msh> <output.smb>
3. Derive a SCOREC model from the SCOREC mesh:
   mkmodel <input.smb> <output.dmg>

Note that, at the moment, the full geometric information is not preserved with the GMSH workflow as the model - hence geometry - is derived from the mesh.
This means that mesh adaptation will adapt to the geometry described by the initial mesh instead of the true geometric model.

//*******//
Simmetrix
//*******//

1. Given the Simmetrix model (.smd), convert it to a SCOREC model:
   mdlConvert <input.smd> <output.dmg>
2. Given the Simmetrix mesh (.sms) convert it to a SCOREC mesh:
   convert <input.smd> <input.sms> <output.smb>

An integer suffix will be appended to the SCOREC mesh name in (2).
This integer corresponds to the MPI rank that will load the file and is needed in a parallel implementation.

//*******//
Partitioning the mesh
//*******//

To partition the resultant SCOREC mesh into some output-directory, we use the split executable:

   mpirun -np <number of processors> split <model.dmg> <mesh.smb> <output-directory/> <number of processors>

The result is a directory with .smb files whose names are integers from 0 to (<number of processors> - 1).
It is best to prepend the model name for consistency: 

   cd <output-directory>
   for f in *; do mv $f <model-name>$f; done
